*We built a clock!* An analog clock. For our project, we used Processing, a language and IDE built on Java. This allowed us to more simply tackle the challenges of visually creating an analog clock. Using our clock you can set the time (hours, minutes, seconds, AM/PM), switch between 12 and 24 hour mode, and also toggle between several difference clock face designs (even a :pizza: clock).
